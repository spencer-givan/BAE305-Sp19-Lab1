# BAE 305, Lab 1 - Well Equipped
# By: Spencer Givan
# Summary
The overall goal for this lab was an introduction on how to use several essential pieces of electronic test equipment. The main reason it is important that we learn how to use the equipment now is because, they will be used in future labs and a basic knowledge must be formed now for later success in the future.
# Materials
We used the following materials in this lab
- Four different Capacitors
- Four different Resistors, Coloring codes are: Grey Red Black Gold - Red Red Black Gold - Yellow Purple Green Gold - Brown Black Red Gold
- Circuit Wires
- A Proto Board
# Assembly Procedures
The following procedures can be found in the below section of 'Test Procedures' since the two go hand in hand.
# Test Equipment
The follwoing was used as our test equipment
- Fluke Digital Multimeter (DMM)
- Generic Digital Multimeter
- Oscilloscope
- Function Generator
- Direct Current Power Supply
- Dedicated Capacitance Meter
# Test Procedures
- Objective 1 - Use the lab equipment to verify values and measurements of components
 Task 1. 
 - Using a Fluke and Generice Digital Multimeters (DMM), determine the actual values of the four given resistors and seperate in a table.
 - Now, use a color coded chart to determine the actual resistance and tolerance of the provided resistor.
 Task 2. 
 - Repeat step one for the four given capacitors. Except this time, calculate the expected capacitance by reading the code and reffering to the provided chart.
 Task 3. 
 - Set up the given D.C. power supply, set up the voltage output V1 to +1.5V, +5.0, +7.0V, +12.0V. Measure the actual values with the provided DMM. 
 - Now, repeat for the V2 output.
 - Compare the measured values on the DMM to the meter on the front of the power supply.
 Task 4. 
 - Connect the Function Generator (FG) to the proto board and set a 2kHz sine wave of maximum amplitude. Observe the wave on the oscilloscope. 
 - Measure amplitude and frequency of the wave in the five different ways. Compare these values to the values on the Function Generator itself. Summarize. For all values, we meausred peak to peak.
    1. “Counting squares” on the oscilloscope screen
    2. Using the moveable cursors on the oscilloscope
    3. Using the measurement features of the oscilloscope
    4. Generic DMM
    5. Fluke DMM 
# Test Results

 The test results showed us that when you measure values for resistors, capacitors, and other lab tools, they all are very similar to the value that it is supposed to be. 
# Discussion
Q1: For Step 2, Do the instruments agree with each other and with the expected value?
The instruments values and the expected values are close to each other.
Q2: For Step 3, Do the instruments agree with each other?
For the most part, the values were all similar to each other when comparing the actual value to the instrument.
Q3: For Step 4, Do the instruments agree?
The instruments all have similar range for their values, so they agree.
