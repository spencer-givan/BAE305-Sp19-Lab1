# BAE 305, Lab 1 - Well Equipped
# By: Spencer Givan
# Summary
The overall goal for this lab was an introduction on how to use several essential pieces of electronic test equipment. The main reason it is important that we learn how to use the equipment now is because, they will be used in future labs and a basic knowledge must be formed now for later success in the future.

# Test Procedure
- Objective 1 - Use the lab equipment to verify values and measurements of components
 1. Using a Fluke and Generice Digital Multimeters (DMM), determine the actual values of the four given resistors and seperate in a table.
 2. Repeat step one for the four given capacitors.
 3. Set up the given D.C. power supply, set up the voltage output V1 and V2 to +1.5V, +5.0, +7.0V, +12.0V. Measure the actual values with the provided DMM. Compare the measured values on the DMM to the meter on the front of the power supply.
 4. Connect the Function Generator (FG) to the proto board and set a 2kHz sine wave of maximum amplitude. Observe the wave. Measure amplitude and frequency of the wave in the five different ways. Compare these values to the values on the Function Generator itself. Summarize.
    1. “Counting squares” on the oscilloscope screen
    2. Using the moveable cursors on the oscilloscope
    3. Using the measurement features of the oscilloscope
    4. Generic DMM
    5. Fluke DMM

# Discussion
Q1: For Step 2, Do the instruments agree with each other and with the expected value?
The instruments values and the expected values are close to each other.
Q2: For Step 3, Do the instruments agree with each other?
For the most part, the values were all similar to each other when comparing the actual value to the instrument.
Q3: For Step 4, Do the instruments agree?
The instruments all have similar range for their values, so they agree.
