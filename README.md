# BAE 305, Lab 1 - Well Equipped
# By: Spencer Givan
# Summary
The overall goal for this lab was an introduction on how to use several essential pieces of electronic test equipment. The main reason it is so important that we learn how to use the equipment now is because they will be used in future labs and a basic knowledge must be formed now for later success in the future.
